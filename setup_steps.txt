Steps to Setup Virtual Environment and Resolve ipykernel Issues
=================================================================

Problem: Jupyter notebook was unable to run cells with Python 3.13.11 due to missing ipykernel package.

Solution Steps:
---------------

1. Configured Python Environment
   - Used the configure_python_environment tool to set up the virtual environment (.venv)
   - Environment Type: venv
   - Python Version: 3.13.11
   - Virtual environment path: /home/jorgevaztmac/Documents/Project_PdM/Predictive-Logistics-Churn-Early-Warning-System-/.venv

2. Installed Project Dependencies from requirements.txt
   - numpy==2.4.0
   - pandas==2.3.3
   - python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
   - pytz==2025.2
   - setuptools==80.9.0
   - six==1.17.0
   - tzdata==2025.3
   - wheel==0.45.1

3. Initial ipykernel Installation Attempt
   - Tried installing ipykernel using install_python_packages tool
   - Installation completed but kernel was still not accessible

4. Force Reinstall ipykernel with All Dependencies
   Command: /home/jorgevaztmac/Documents/Project_PdM/Predictive-Logistics-Churn-Early-Warning-System-/.venv/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel -U --force-reinstall
   
   This installed:
   - ipykernel-7.1.0
   - ipython-9.8.0
   - jupyter-client-8.7.0
   - jupyter-core-5.9.1
   - And all required dependencies (debugpy, traitlets, pyzmq, tornado, etc.)

5. Activated Virtual Environment
   Command: source .venv/bin/activate
   - Verified activation by checking Python path
   - Confirmed Python 3.13.11 from .venv was being used

6. Installed Jupyter Kernel Spec (Key Step)
   Command: .venv/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv_predictive_logistics --display-name="Python 3.13.11 (.venv)"
   
   This registered the virtual environment kernel with Jupyter so it can be selected in notebooks.
   Kernel was installed to: /home/jorgevaztmac/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/venv_predictive_logistics

7. Final Step (Manual)
   - In VS Code, click the kernel selector in the top right of the notebook
   - Select "Python 3.13.11 (.venv)" from the kernel list
   - The notebook will now use the properly configured virtual environment

Key Insights:
-------------
- Installing ipykernel in the virtual environment is not enough
- The kernel spec must be registered with Jupyter using: python -m ipykernel install --user
- VS Code needs to be pointed to the correct kernel through the kernel selector
- The issue was that the notebook was trying to use /bin/python instead of the virtual environment's Python

Verification Commands:
---------------------
which python        # Should show: .venv/bin/python
python --version    # Should show: Python 3.13.11
python -m pip list  # Should show all installed packages including ipykernel
